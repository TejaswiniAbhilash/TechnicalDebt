# TechnicalDebt
Identify the technical debts in the Project
1. The tickets created for the process improvement 4 to 5 years back have to be addressed. Back then, the project manager did not address them moving them to backlog as they were not considered high prio during that time because project was facusing on development and delivery. Now, since the project is in maintanace phase, changing the process at this phase of the project is difficult. The ticlets have now been piled up.
      Debt Quadrant - Deliberate & Prudent
      Cause - Lack of knowledge and Poor communication
      Symptom - Slow development
3. One of the feature requested by the customer, we could not meet the timeline because we encountered unexpected issues which we could not resolve on time. The expert support also did not much. Later we identified the issue and resolved it but had many escaltions from customer for not meeting timeline and questioning the competency of the team as well.
Lessons Learned have to be captured so that we do not repeat such mistake in future. It is still pending from my side.
